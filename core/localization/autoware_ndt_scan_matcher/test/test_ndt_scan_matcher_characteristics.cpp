/// @brief Characterization tests for `NDTScanMatcher`.
///
/// These tests exist to make a refactor provable, not to specify desirable behavior. They pin
/// what the node does *today*, through its ROS surface (`/diagnostics`, output topics, services),
/// so that extracting the decision logic into a ROS-free core can be shown to preserve it.
///
/// Rules that keep them trustworthy:
///
///  - **Assert current behavior, even when it looks wrong.** Cases marked `SUSPICIOUS` pin
///    behavior that reads like a bug. They are deliberately frozen; changing them is a separate,
///    explicit decision, not a side effect of a refactor.
///  - **Never assert NDT numerics.** Alignment runs under OpenMP and the initial-pose search
///    draws from a process-global RNG, so pose/score values are not reproducible. Assert
///    decisions, key sets, levels and message text instead.
///  - **Override every parameter an assertion depends on**, even when it already matches the
///    shipped yaml, so a config change cannot silently flip a test.
///  - **Prefer `absent(key)` to witness ordering.** The diagnostics key set is the only evidence
///    of which gate short-circuited which.
///
/// One binary, one node per test: each test builds its own `NdtHarness`, whose destructor tears
/// the node down in a specific order. Tests never call `rclcpp::shutdown()`.
